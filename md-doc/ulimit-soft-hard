Could you tell me what it’s the difference between hard and soft limits?
People told me soft is like warning and hard is real max limit, but I’m not sure

Yup, you are correct about soft and hard limit. For example, following will prevent anyone in the student group from having more than 50 processes, and a warning will be given at 30 processes.

@student soft nproc 30
@student hard nproc 50
